The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal, It is the courage to continue that counts.
A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take.
Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Do not count the days, make the days count.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
You cannot cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.
Believe you can and you are halfway there.
Your time is limited, do not waste it living someone elses life.
Opportunities do not happen, you create them.
Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall.
Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
I am not a product of my circumstances, I am a product of my decisions.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss
